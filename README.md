# Carve

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/borkdude/carve/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/borkdude/carve/tree/master)

Carve out the essentials of your Clojure app.

## Rationale

Carve will search through your code for unused vars and will remove them.

## Status

Experimental. Use with caution! Breaking changes may happen. Feedback and bugfix PRs welcome.

## Installation

### CLI

#### Brew (linux and macOS)

     brew install borkdude/brew/carve

### Arch (Linux)

`carve` is [available](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/carve-bin/) in the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org). It can be installed using your favorite [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) helper such as
[yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), [yaourt](https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt), [apacman](https://github.com/oshazard/apacman) and [pacaur](https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur). Here is an example using `yay`:

    yay -S carve-bin

<!-- #### Scoop (Windows) -->

<!-- See [scoop-clojure](https://github.com/littleli/scoop-clojure). -->

### Manual

Grab the binary for your OS at [Github releases](https://github.com/borkdude/carve/releases).


### JVM

Add to your `deps.edn` under the `:aliases` key:

``` clojure
:carve {:extra-deps {borkdude/carve {:git/url "https://github.com/borkdude/carve"
                                     :sha "<SHA>"}}
        :main-opts ["-m" "carve.main"]}
```

where the latest SHA can be found with:

``` shell
$ git ls-remote https://github.com/borkdude/carve.git refs/heads/master
```

## How does it work?

Carve invokes [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo) and uses the [analysis](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/tree/master/analysis) information to check which vars are unused. To remove the relevant bits of code it uses [rewrite-cljc](https://github.com/lread/rewrite-cljc-playground).

## Usage

The usage for a typical Clojure app looks like:

``` shell
carve --opts '{:paths ["src" "test"]}'
```

for the CLI or:

```
clojure -M:carve --opts '{:paths ["src" "test"]}'
```

on the JVM.

You can also store the config for your project in `.carve/config.edn`. When
invoking carve with no options, the options in `.carve/config.edn` will be
used. When providing options, the CLI options will be merged into those provided
in `.carve/config.edn`.

Currently `carve` only has one command line option, `--opts`, which expects an
EDN map or EDN file with the following options of which only `:paths` is
required:

- `:paths`: a list of paths to analyze. Can be a mix of individual files and directories.
- `:ignore-vars`: a list of vars to ignore. Useful for when the analyzer has it wrong or you just want to keep the var for whatever reason.
- `:api-namespaces`: a list of namespaces of which only unused private vars will
  be reported.
- `:carve-ignore-file`: a file where ignored vars can be stored, `.carve/ignore`
  by default.
- `:interactive`: ask what to do with an unused var: remove from the file, add
  to `.carve/ignore` or continue. Set to `true` by default.
- `:out-dir`: instead of writing back to the original file, write to this dir.
- `:dry-run`: just print the unused var expression.
- `:aggressive`: runs multiple times until no unused vars are left. Defaults to `false`.
- `:report`: when truthy, prints unused vars to stdout. Implies `:dry-run
  true`. The output format may be set using `:report {:format ...}` where format
  can be `:edn` or `:text`. The text output can be interpreted by editors like
  Emacs. This option can be combined with `:aggressive`.
- `:silent`: when truthy, does not write to stdout. Implies `:interactive false`.
- `:clj-kondo/config`: a map of clj-kondo config opts that are passed on to
  clj-kondo, which is used to analyze usages. e.g.: passing `{:skip-comments
  true}` will ignore function usage in `(comment)` forms. Note that the config
  in `.clj-kondo/config.edn` is used as well - options passed with this key will
  override options set in the clj-kondo config file.

``` shell
$ clojure -M:carve --opts '{:paths ["test-resources"] :dry-run true}'
Carving test-resources/app.clj

Found unused var:
(defn unused-function [])

...

Carving test-resources/api.clj

Found unused var:
(defn- private-lib-function [])

...
```

``` shell
$ clojure -M:carve --opts '{:paths ["test-resources"]}'
Carving test-resources/app.clj

Found unused var:
(defn unused-function [])

Type Y to remove or i to add app/unused-function to .carve/ignore
n
Found unused var:
(defn another-unused-function [])

Type Y to remove or i to add app/another-unused-function to .carve/ignore
i
...

$ cat .carve/ignore
app/another-unused-function
```

Keep in mind that if you ran `carve` with `'{:paths ["src" "test"]}'`, there might still be potentially lots of unused code, which wasn't detected simply because there are tests for it.

So after a first cycle of carving you might want to do another run with simply `{:paths ["src"]}`, which will help deleting the rest of the unused code.
*Just beware that this will break all the tests using the code you just deleted, and you'll have to fix/delete them manually.**

Carve also removes any unused refers from namespace `:require` forms. This means
_any_ unused refer, not just refers for functions determined to be unused by
carve.

### CI integration

A good use case for Carve is the CI integration, to ensure that no one can introduce dead code into a codebase.
This example shows how to add this step into CircleCI, but any other CI configuration will be similar.

First add this configuration into a `.circleci/deps.edn` file:

```clojure
{:aliases
 {:carve {:extra-deps {borkdude/carve {:git/url "https://github.com/borkdude/carve"
                                       :sha "$LATEST_CARVE_SHA"}}
          :main-opts ["-m" "carve.main"]}}}
```

Then configure your build step like this:

```yaml
find_dead_code:
  working_directory: ~/$your-project
  docker:
    - image: circleci/clojure:openjdk-11-tools-deps

  steps:
    - checkout
    - run: mkdir -p ~/.clojure && cp .circleci/deps.edn ~/.clojure/deps.edn
    - run: clojure -M:carve --opts '{:paths ["src" "test"] :report {:format :text}}'
```

If the `report` step finds any dead code it exits with status code `1`, thus failing the build step.

### Emacs

#### Report mode

Running carve with in report mode (for example `clojure -M:carve --opts '{:paths
["src" "test"] :report {:format :text}}'`) you can make all the links clickable
by switching to compilation-mode.

### Running tests

If you want to run tests in Emacs and Cider you need to use the test alias, or
it will fail while trying to load the `test.check` library.  You can place this in
your `.dir-locals.el` file in the root directory to always use the test alias:

```elisp
((clojure-mode . ((cider-clojure-cli-global-options . "-R:test"))))
```

or alter the command used by `cider-jack-in` by prefixing the invocation with
`C-u`.
